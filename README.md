### Hi there :wave:

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### :astronaut: About me

So I am a software developer who actively develops since 2003. Given this quite plenty of time, I managed to learn a multitude of different languages and technologies. I encourage you to browse my public projects. I hope you will find something interesting :thinking:.

I like everything related to computers (from the transistor to the cloud), but given the extreme shortage of available hours in the day, I can hardly be an expert in everything (doing my best, though!) :smiley:. Nevertheless, I am quite good at implementing and integrating various things, from embedded, through web, mobile & desktop apps, to server-side software. I have also hands-on experience in configuring and managing servers and clouds. Also, I love automating things, both in real and virtual worlds.

On my daily basis, I use Linux with Arch Linux and OpenBox on it, optimized and customized over the years to nanoseconds :upside_down_face: performance for the best possible work efficiency :stuck_out_tongue:.

### :briefcase: Work

I am a freelancer, who is always looking for great opportunities, especially long-term relationships. So if you have anything in mind, feel free to contact me!

### :zap: Something else?

Despite being a software developer, I really like hardware and electronics too.

I design and etch PCBs as well as write code for microcontrollers, just to force my code to do something physical actually :slightly_smiling_face: I encourage you to check my [Gallery](https://krystiand.net/gallery) where I posted a lot of various devices I created as hobby projects :slightly_smiling_face:.
